Welcome to the MPLAB Harmony Integrated Software Framework!

Your installation is almost complete. Only a few steps remain.

If you already have the MPLAB X IDE installed on your system, you need to open it and
install two MPLAB Harmony "plugins".  

1. The MPLAB Harmony "Help" system plugin:

   <install-root>/docs/org-microchip-harmony_help.nbm
   
   This plugin will make all of the MPLAB Harmony help documentation available to you
   from within the MPLAB X IDE.
   
2. The MPLAB Harmony Configuration Wizard plugin:

   <install-root>/utilities/configurator/com-microchip-harmonyconfigurator.nbm
   
   Installing this plugin will add the "MPLAB Harmony Configuration Wizard" to the 
   "Tools" menu in MPLAB X IDE.  This tool will allow you to select MPLAB Harmony
   libraries from a convenient graphical interface, insert the appropriate 
   source files into your MPLAB X IDE projects, and generate a set of "starter"
   files to help you create your own MPLAB Harmony projects.  
   
   (Refer to the MPLAB Harmony help documentation for additional information.)

To install these plugins into MPLAB X IDE, follow these steps:

1. From the MPLAB X IDE "Tools" menu, choose "Plugins". A dialog box appears.
2. Select the "Downloaded" tab in the dialog box.
3. Click "Add Plugins..." and navigate to the directory paths listed previously 
   for each plugin.
4. Select the plugin file (that ends with ".nbm") and click "Open".
5. Ensure that the selected plugin is listed and the "Install" box is checked.
6. Click "Install" and follow the on-screen directions.

   Note:  You may need to restart MPLAB X IDE for the plugin to become effective.

Refer to the MPLAB X IDE documentation for additional information on plugins.   

Note: If you are not using MPLAB X IDE or have not yet installed it, you still have
access to the full MPLAB Harmony help system as it is provided in the following pdf file.

   <install-root>/doc/help_harmony.pdf

Enjoy!
