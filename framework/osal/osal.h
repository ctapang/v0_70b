  Remarks:
    This version of the OSAL_SEM_Post function should be used if the
    program is, or may be, operating inside an ISR. The OSAL will take the
    necessary steps to ensure correct operation possibly disabling
    interrupts or entering a critical section. The exact requirements will
    depend upon the particular RTOS being used.

  Summary:
    Creates an OSAL thread with the specified parameters.

  Description:
    This function creates an OSAL thread. The thread function is implemented
    as a simple task that will normally not return (i.e., a while(1) loop).
    The name is not used by the OSAL, but may be used by the RTOS for diagnostic
    and reporting purposes.
    The thread is created with a fixed stack size that is allocated from one
    of the available memory pools or more normally from the heap. The priority
    of the thread is an 8-bit quantity with higher values denoting threads
    of a higher priority.
    Optionally, a parameter may be passed to the thread function that can be used
    to implement per instance behavior. For example, one LED flashing task could
    be created several times with the LED number passed as a parameter at creation
    time.
    A handle to the created thread is returned in pHandle.
    Threads may be created prior to the RTOS starting, however, no execution will
    occur until it is started. A created thread is immediately placed into
    the READY state and is able to run provided that it is the highest priority
    thread when all threads are evaluated by the kernel, either during normal
    operation, or at RTOS start-up time.

  Precondition:
    Thread function must exist in program memory.

  Parameters:
    task        - Name of the function that implements the thread code

    name        - Textual name of the thread. Not used by the OSAL but may be
                  used by the RTOS for diagnostic and tracing purposes.

    stack_size  - Size of the stack associated with a thread in bytes. The RTOS
                  will allocate this many bytes from any underlying memory pool
                  or the heap.

    priority    - Priority of the thread from 1-255. Higher values indicate threads
                  with higher priorities. It is left down to the underlying RTOS
                  whether threads of the same priority are permitted or if threads
                  should be given a unique priority.

    pData       - Pointer to data passed to the thread. Optionally, NULL may be passed.

    pHandle     - Pointer to a variable that can contain the created threads handle

  Returns:
    OSAL_RESULT_TRUE    - Thread successfully created

    OSAL_RESULT_FALSE   - Thread not created or insufficient memory available

  Example:

/* Function: OSAL_RESULT OSAL_THREAD_Sleep(uint16_t waitMS)

  Summary:
    Puts the currently executing thread to sleep.

  Description:
    This function puts the currently executing thread to sleep. Execution of the
    current thread is placed into a blocked state for the specified amount of time.
     The exact amount of time that the thread will sleep will depend upon the
     granularity of the underlying pre-emptive tick.

  Precondition:
    Thread must have been created.

  Parameters:
    waitMS     - Number of milliseconds the thread will be blocked

  Returns:
    OSAL_RESULT_TRUE - Call succeeded

  Example:
    <code>
     while (1)
     {
        // sleep for 500ms
        OSAL_THREAD_Sleep(500);

/* Function: OSAL_RESULT OSAL_THREAD_CreateDaemon(OSAL_THREAD_FUNCTION task)

  Summary:
    Creates a Daemon thread for use with multi-threaded Harmony drivers.

  Description:
    This function will create a daemon or system thread designed to assist
    Harmony driver modules with their operation.
    Some Harmony drivers will incorporate state machines or other loop strucutres
    that must be periodically called for the driver to continue operating.
    For instance, a USART driver may have a state machine that manages the
    prioritization and transmission of data from multiple clients. This could
    work in addition to any processing that occurs when operating under
    interrupts so it will have a separate DRV_xxxx_Tasks routine (or similar)
    that must be periodically called.
    Since the prioritization and frequency of these calls is only known to
    the programmer when designing the end application, the OSAL provides
    a lightweight thread mechanism that is primarily intended to be used
    internally by MPLAB Harmony. The Daemon threads have a fixed size stack
    (defined in system_config.h) and operate at a fixed priority.

  Precondition:
    Daemon function must exist in program memory.

  Parameters:
    task      - The name of the function that implements the Daemon

  Returns:
    OSAL_RESULT_TRUE    - Thread successfully created

    OSAL_RESULT_FALSE   - Thread not created or insufficient memory available

  Example:
    <code>
    // inside driver initialization routine
    ...
    OSAL_THREAD_CreateDaemon(DRV_USART_Tasks);

/* Function: void OSAL_ISR_Enter()

  Summary:
    Informs the OSAL and RTOS that an ISR is being entered.

  Description:
     This function allows the OSAL and RTOS to implement any set up required
     should an OSAL function be called during the interrupt handler.
     Depending on the underlying RTOS, it may be necessary to set a global
     flag indicating that an interrupt is currently being executed for the
     correct context code to be executed during calls to the kernel.
     OSAL_ISR_Enter allows the RTOS to implement the required functions.

  Precondition:
    None, (in an interrupt handler).

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
     void __ISR(UART_2_VECTOR) _UART2RXHandler()
     {
        char c;

        OSAL_ISR_Enter();

/* Function: void OSAL_ISR_Exit()

  Summary:

  Description:
     This function allows the OSAL and RTOS to implement any restoration required
     after an ISR has completed.
     Depending on the underlying RTOS, it may be necessary to set a global
     flag indicating that an interrupt is currently being executed for the correct
     context code to be executed during calls to the kernel.

/* Function: void* OSAL_Malloc(size_t size)

  Summary:
    Allocates memory using the OSAL default allocator.

  Description:
     This function allocates a block of memory from the default allocator from
     the underlying RTOS. If no RTOS is present, it defaults to malloc.
     Many operating systems incorporate their own memory allocation scheme, using
     pools, blocks or by wrapping the standard C library functions in a critical
     section. Since an Harmony application may not know what target OS is being used
     (if any), this function ensures that the correct thread safe memory
     allocator will be used.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    size      - Size of the requested memory block in bytes

  Returns:
     Pointer to the block of allocated memory. NULL is returned if memory could
     not be allocated.

  Example:
    <code>
    // create a working array
    uint8_t* pData;

     pData = OSAL_Malloc(32);
     if (pData != NULL)
     {

  Summary:
    Deallocates a block of memory and return to the default pool.

  Description:
     This function deallocates memory and returns it to the default pool.
     In an RTOS-based application, the memory may have been allocated from
     multiple pools or simply from the heap.
     In non-RTOS applications, this function calls the C standard function
     free.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    pData      - Pointer to the memory block to be set free

  Returns:

/* Function: OSAL_RESULT OSAL_Initialize()

  Summary:
    Performs OSAL initialization.

  Description:
     This function performs OSAL initialization .This function should be called
     near the start of main in an application that will use an underlying RTOS.
     This permits the RTOS to perform any one time initialization before the
     application attempts to create drivers or other items that may use the RTOS.
     Typical actions performed by OSAL_Initialize would be to allocate and
     prepare any memory pools for later use.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    OSAL_RESULT_TRUE  - Initialization completed successfully.

  Example:
    <code>

  Description:
     This function starts the underlying RTOS application. The application will not
     normally return from this function call since the RTOS and interrupts will
     be responsible for all program operation. A return from this function is
     usually fatal and indicates that the program has failed in some way.

/* Function: void OSAL_ErrorCallback(OSAL_ERROR_CALLBACK_TYPE type)

  Summary:
    Lightweight error handling callback function for the RTOS.

  Description:
    The callback function will be executed whenever an error occurs within
    an underlying RTOS. The OSAL implements this function as a weak type
    allowing it to be overridden by the user.
    The type and severity of errors that can be encountered by an RTOS will
    vary according to the specific implementation so this only provides
    lightweight error handling. There is no expectation that the function
    should return and if this does happen there is no guarantee that the
    RTOS will continue to function properly. A user application could override
    this function and provide simple signalling of the error such as logging
    a message or flashing a light.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    type      - Type of error

                OSAL_ERROR_CALLBACK_DEFAULT,          Default error

                OSAL_ERROR_CALLBACK_OUT_OF_MEMORY,    Memory allocation error

                OSAL_ERROR_CALLBACK_STACK_OVERFLOW,   Stack overflow in a thread

                OSAL_ERROR_CALLBACK_ERROR,            Generic error
