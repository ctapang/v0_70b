	file system. Hence the following structure is not immediately useful for the

/*Function:
    SYS_FS_RESULT SYS_FS_Initialize(const void* initData)

    Summary:
        Initializes the File system Abstration Layer (sys_fs layer).

    Description:
        Initializes the abstraction layer (sys_fs layer) and sets up the necessary parameters.

    Precondition:
        This is the first function to be called during usage of sys_fs.
		Calling other functions from sys_fs without initializing the sys_fs will
		cause un-predictable behavior.

    Parameters:
        initData	-	The pointer to array of the type SYS_FS_REGISTRATION_TABLE, 
						but type casted to (const void *).
						The number of elements of array is decided by the definition 
						SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE. If the application uses 1 file system 
						(say only FAT FS), then SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE is defined to be 1. 
						Otherwise, if the application uses 2 file systems (say FAT FS and MPFS2), 
						then SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE is defined to be 2. The 
						SYS_FS_MAX_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE has to be defined in system_config.h file.

        If Failure	-	SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE
		
		The reason for failure could be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error

		<code>
		// This code snippet shows an example of how the

/*Function:
    SYS_FS_RESULT SYS_FS_Mount(const char *devName, const char *mountName, 
	SYS_FS_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE filesystemtype, unsigned long mountflags, const void *data);

    Summary:
        Mount filesystems

    Description:
        The mount command attaches the filesystem specified to a volume. 
						  
		When a media (say, SD card or USB thumb drive) is attached to the system, the 
		SYS_FS_Tasks() function needs to run atleast 8 times (for each partition),
		from the SYS_Tasks(), before the volume names are assigned to each partitions. 
		Hence it is mandatory that the SYS_FS_Tasks() is run periodically.
		Also, it is mandatory that the SYS_FS_Mount() function call from the application code, is 
		not blocking. The application code has to allow the SYS_FS_Tasks() to
		run periodically while calling the SYS_FS_Mount function. If the SYS_FS_Mount() is called
		in a blocking mode, then the SYS_Tasks() never gets a chance to run and hence, the media 
		will not be analyzed and finally, the SYS_FS_Mount will never succed. This will result 
		in a dead-lock.

		There is no mechanism available for the application to know if the specified volume (devName)
		is really attached or not. The only available possibilty is to keep trying to mount the volume
		(with the devname), untill success is achieved. 	
		It is prudent that the application code implements a time out mechanism while trying to
		mount a volume (by calling SYS_FS_Mount). The trial for mount should continue atleast
		10 times before before assuming that the mount will never succedeed. This has to be done
		for every new volume to be mounted.
		
		The name standard of volume (devName) used in Harmony file system is as below: -
		
		For NVM			- "nvm" "media number" "volume number"	
		
		For SD card		- "mmcblk" "media number" "volume number"	
		
		For MSD			- "sd" "media number" "volume number"	
		
		Where, "media number" 	- a, b, c... depending upon number of media of certain type 
						  connected.
						  
	    Where, "volume number"	- 1, 2, 3... depending upon number of partitions in that
						  media.		
		
		The convention for assigning names to volumes is given by an example: -
		
		If an SD card (with 4 partitiona) is attached to the system, and assuming all 4
		partitions are recognized, then there will be 4 devNames -- mmcblka1, mmcblka2, mmcblka3
		and mmcblka4.
		
		Subsequently, a NVM media is attached which has only 1 partition, then the devname
		will be -- nvma1.
		
		Later, another SD card is attached to the system which has 1 partition, then the devname
		will be -- mmcblkb1.
		
		Finally, there will be 6 volume names (or devNames), which is available for the application
		to be mounted and used for file system.

    Precondition:
        The "devName" name for the volume has to be known. 
		The file sytem type with which each of the volumes are formatted has to be known. 
		Trying to mount a volume with a file system which is different from what the volume
		is actually formatted, will cause mounting failure.

    Parameters:
        devName 		- The device name (name of volume) which needs to be mounted. The devName
						  has to be preceeded by the string "/dev/".
						  
        mountName 		- Mount name for the device to be mounted. This is a name provided
						  by the user. In future, while accessing the mounted volume (say,
						  during SYS_FS_FileOpen operation), the mountName is used to refer the
						  path for file. The mount name has to be preceeded by the string
						  "/mnt/"
						  
        filesystemtype 	- native file system of SYS_FS_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE type.
		
        mountflags 		- mounting control flags. This parameter is reserved for future
						  enhancements. Hence, always pass zero.
						  
        data 			- The data argument is interpreted by the different file systems. 
					      This parameter is reserved for future enhancements. Hence, always 
						  pass NULL.

    Returns:
        If Success		- SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS
		
        If Failure		- SYS_FS_RES_FAILURE
		
		The reason for failure could be retrieved with SYS_FS_Error

	Example:
		<code>
			switch(appState)
			{
				case TRY_MOUNT:
					if(SYS_FS_Mount("/dev/mmcblka1", "/mnt/myDrive", FAT, 0, NULL) != SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS)
					{
						// Failure, hence try mouting again
					}
					else
					{
						// Mount was successful. Do further file operations
						appState = DO_FURTHER_STUFFS;
						
					}
					break;

  Description:
	The SYS_FS_FileSeek() function shall set the file pointer for a open file associated with

    If whence is SYS_FS_SEEK_SET, the file offset shall be set to offset bytes from the begining.
	
    If whence is SYS_FS_SEEK_CUR, the file offset shall be set to its current location plus offset.
	
    If whence is SYS_FS_SEEK_END, the file offset shall be set to the size of the file plus offset. If
	SYS_FS_SEEK_END is selected, then offset has to be a negative number, inorder for the file pointer
	to be valid.
	
	Trying to move the file pointer using SYS_FS_FileSeek, beyond the range of file will only cause the
	pointer to be moved to the last location of the file.

  Precondition:
    A valid file handle must be obtained before seeking a file. 

  Parameters:
    handle				- A valid file handle obtained during file open.
	
	offset				- The number of bytes which act as file offset. This value could be a positive
						  or negative value.
	whence				- File seek control input of type SYS_FS_FILE_SEEK_CONTROL.

  Returns:
	If Success			- The number of bytes by which file pointer is moved (0 or positive number)
