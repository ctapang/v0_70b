  Summary:
    Initializes the USART instance for the specified driver index

  Description:
    This routine initializes the USART driver instance for the specified driver 
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Input:
    index  - Identifier for the instance to be initialized
    
    init   - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary to
             initialize the drivver. This pointer may be null if no data is
             required because static overrides have been provided.

  Return:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.  
    Otherwise, it returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:

    This routine must be called before any other USART routine is called.

    instance.

    This routine will NEVER block for hardware access. If the operation requires
    time to allow the hardware to re-initialize, it will be reported by the 
    DRV_USART_Status operation. The system must use DRV_USART_Status to find out 
    when the driver is in the ready state.  
    
    Build configuration options may be used to staticaly override options in the 
    "init" sructure and will take precedance over initialization data passed

/* Function:
    void DRV_USART_Deinitialize( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object )

  Summary:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the USART driver module

  Description:
    Deinitializes the specified instance of the USART driver module, disabling 
    its operation (and any hardware).  Invalidates all the internal data.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_USART_Initialize should have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    object          - Driver object handle, returned from the 
                      DRV_USART_Initialize routine

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     //  Returned from DRV_USART_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;


    DRV_USART_Deinitialize(object);

    status = DRV_USART_Status(object);
    if (SYS_MODULE_DEINITIALIZED != status)
    {
        // Check again later if you need to know 
        // when the driver is deinitialized.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Once the Initialize operation has been called, the Deinitialize operation
    must be called before the Initialize operation can be called again.

    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the operation 
    requires time to allow the hardware to complete, this will be reported by 
    the DRV_USART_Status operation.  The system has to use DRV_USART_Status to find 
    out when the module is in the ready state.

  Summary:
    Gets the current status of the USART driver module.

  Description:
    This routine provides the current status of the USART driver module.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_USART_Initialize should have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    object          - Driver object handle, returned from the 
                      DRV_USART_Initialize routine

  Returns:
    SYS_STATUS_READY          - Indicates that the driver is busy with a 
                                previous system level operation and cannot start
                                another
                                
                                Note Any value greater than SYS_STATUS_READY is
                                also a normal running state in which the driver
                                is ready to accept new operations.
                                
    SYS_STATUS_BUSY           - Indicates that the driver is busy with a 
                                previous system level operation and cannot start
                                another
                                
    SYS_STATUS_ERROR          - Indicates that the driver is in an error state
                                
                                Note:  Any value less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR is 
                                also an error state.
    
    SYS_MODULE_DEINITIALIZED  - Indicates that the driver has been 
                                de-initialized
                                
                                Note:  This value is less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     // Returned from DRV_USART_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          usartStatus;

    usartStatus = DRV_USART _Status(object);
    else if (SYS_STATUS_ERROR >= usartStatus)
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The this operation can be used to determine when any of the driver's module 
    level operations has completed.
    
    If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_BUSY, the a previous operation 
    has not yet completed.  Once the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_READY, 
    any previous operations have completed.

    The value of SYS_STATUS_ERROR is negative (-1).  Any value less than that is
    also an error state.

    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.
    
    If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be cleared by
    calling the reinitialize operation.  If that fails, the deinitialize
    operation will need to be called, followed by the initialize operation to
    return to normal operations.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified timer driver instance and returns a handle to it

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified USART driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_USART_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex    - Identifier for the object instance to be opened
    
    intent      - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                  DRV_IO_INTENT "or'd" together to indicate the intended use
                  of the driver

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).
    
    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_USART_Open(DRV_USART_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);
    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_USART_Close routine is called.

    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.
    
    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING is requested and the driver was built 
    appropriately to support blocking behavior, then other client-level
    operations may block waiting on hardware until they are complete.

    If DRV_IO_INTENT_NON_BLOCKING is requested the driver client can call the

  Description:
    This routine closes an opened-instance of the USART driver, invalidating the
    handle.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART driver instance.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:

    calling DRV_USART_Open before the caller may use the driver again.

    If DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING was requested and the driver was built 
    appropriately to support blocking behavior call may block until the 
    operation is complete.

    If DRV_IO_INTENT_NON_BLOCKING request the driver client can call the
    DRV_USART_Status operation to find out when the module is in
    the ready state (the handle is no longer valid).

  Returns:
     The buffer handle, which should be used to query how many bytes have been
     written or read using the function DRV_USART_OperationStatus

  Example:
    <code>
	
	void Callback(void);
    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];

                   open routine
                   
    buffer       - Buffer containing the data write to the USART instance
                   
    numbytes     - Total number of bytes that to write to the USART instance 
                   (must be equal to or less than the size of the buffer)

  Returns:
    Number of bytes actually written to the USART or -1 if there is an error 
    (call DRV_USART_ClientStatus to identify the error)

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE      handle;    // Returned from DRV_USART_Open
    char            myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    unsigned int    count;
    unsigned int    total;

    total = 0;
    do
    {
        count  = DRV_USART_Write(myUSARTHandle, &myBuffer[total], MY_BUFFER_SIZE - total);
        total += count;

        // Do something else...

    } while( total < MY_BUFFER_SIZE );
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING flag was given in the call to the 
    DRV_USART_Open routine and the driver was built to support blocking behavior
    the call will block until the operation is complete.

    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING flag was given in the call to the 
    DRV_USART_Open routine or the driver was built to only support non-blocking 
    behavior the call will return immediately, identifying how many bytes of
    data were actually written to the USART and the client must call 
    DRV_USART_Write again with adjusted parameters as shown in the example.

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    bool DRV_USART_WriteByte( const DRV_HANDLE handle,  const uint8_t byte)

  Summary:
    Writes a byte of data to the USART
    
  Description:
    This routine writes a byte of data to the USART.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART driver instance.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

    DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE or DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE must have been specified in
    the DRV_USART_Open call.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

    byte         - Data byte to write to the USART

  Returns:
    true		  - Write successful.
	false		  - Write failed.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE      handle;    // Returned from DRV_USART_Open
    
    bool    		status;
    
    // Pre-initialize myBuffer with MY_BUFFER_SIZE bytes of valid data.

         status =   DRV_USART_WriteByte(handle, myBuffer[numBytes++]);

        // Do something else...
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING flag was given in the call to the 
    DRV_USART_Open routine and the driver was built to support blocking behavior
    the call will block until the operation is complete.

    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING flag was given in the call to the 
    DRV_USART_Open routine or the driver was built to only support non-blocking 
    behavior the call will return immediately.  If the driver was not able to 
    accept the data, an overrun error status will be captured.  To ensure that 
    the driver is ready to accept data, the caller must first check the 
    return value to DRV_USART_TransferStatus as shown in the example.

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    DRV_USART_TRANSFER_STATUS DRV_USART_TransferStatus (const DRV_HANDLE handle)

  Summary:
    Returns the transmitter and receiver transfer status

  Description:
    This returns the transmitter and receiver transfer status.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART driver instance.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.


  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    A DRV_USART_TRANSFER_STATUS value describing the current status of the
    transfer.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;    // Returned from DRV_USART_Open

    if (DRV_USART_TRANSFER_STATUS_TX_EMPTY & DRV_USART_TransferStatus(handle) )
    {
        // All transmitter data has been sent.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The returned status may contain a value with more than one of the bits
    specified in the DRV_USART_TRANSFER_STATUS enumeration set.  The caller
    should perform an "AND" with the bit of interest and verify if the 
    result is non-zero (as shown in the example) to verify the desired status
    bit.

// *****************************************************************************
/*
  Function:
    int8_t DRV_USART_BufferTransferStatus(  const DRV_HANDLE handle,
        const DRV_USART_BUFFER_HANDLE *bufferHandle);

  Summary:
    Gets the number of bytes which are written or read

  Description:
    Gets the number of bytes which are written or read for the transaction
    handle

  Precondition:
    The DRV_USART_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    USART device instance and the DRV_USART_Status must have returned
    SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_USART_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

    The function DRV_USART_BufferAdd should be called before calling
    this function and should have returned a valid buffer handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - Handle of the communication channel as return by the
                   DRV_USART_Open function.
    bufferHandle - Handle of the buffer returned by the DRV_USART_BufferAdd

  Returns:
    The number of bytes read if the buffer id is DRV_IO_BUFFER_READ or number
    of bytes written when the buffer id is DRV_IO_BUFFER_WRITE. If -1 is returned


  Example:
    <code>
	
	void Callback(void);
    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    int8_t bytesWritten = 0;
    DRV_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle = NULL;
    DRV_USART_IO_BUFFER buffer1;
	void Callback(void)

	buffer1.buffer       = writeBuffer2;
	buffer1.bufferSize   = sizeof(writeBuffer2);
	buffer1.xferCallback = Callback;
	buffer1.flags        = DRV_USART_BUFFER_FLAG_WRITE;

    // myUSARTHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_USART_Open function.

    bufferHandle = DRV_USART_BufferAdd(myUSARThandle, &buffer1);
