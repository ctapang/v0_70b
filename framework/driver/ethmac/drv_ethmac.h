  Description:
    This function salculates a CRC-32 using polynomial 0x4C11DB7 and then, using 
    bits 28 through 23 of the CRC, sets the appropriate bit in the ETHHT0-ETHHT1 
    registers.

  Precondition:

  Parameters:
    hMac - Ethernet MAC client handle
    DestMACAddr - 6-byte group destination MAC address to allow through the Hash 
                  Table Filter. If DestMACAddr is set to '0000 0000 0000', the hash
                  table will be cleared of all entries and the filter will be disabled.

  Returns:
    TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK if success,
    an eror code otherwise.

  Example:
<code>
</code>

  Remarks:
    Sets the appropriate bit in the ETHHT0/1 registers to allow packets sent to
    DestMACAddr to be received and enabled the Hash Table receive filter 

    There is no way to individually unset destination MAC 
    addresses from the hash table since it is possible to have 
    a hash collision and therefore multiple MAC addresses 
    relying on the same hash table bit.  The stack would have 
    to individually store each 6 byte MAC address to support 
    this feature, which would waste a lot of RAM and be 
    unnecessary in most applications.  As a simple compromise, 
    you can call DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACRxFilterHashTableEntrySet() using a 
    00-00-00-00-00-00 destination MAC address, which will clear 
    the entire hash table and disable the hash table filter.  
    This will allow you to then readd the necessary destination 
    addresses.

/* Function:
    TCPIP_MAC_RES DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACPacketTx(TCPIP_MAC_HANDLE hMac, TCPIP_MAC_PACKET * ptrPacket);

  Summary:
    A packet is submitted to the MAC driver for transmission.

  Description:
    This is the MAC transmit function.
    The MAC driver has to suport internal queueing!
    A packet is to be rejected only if it's not properly formatted.
    Otherwise it has to be scheduled for transmission in an internal queue!

    Once the packet is scheduled for transmission
    the MAC driver has to set the TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED flag so that the stack
    is aware that this packet is under processing cnd cannot be modified!

    Once the packet is transmitted, the TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED has to be cleared,
    the proper packet acknowledgement result (ackRes) has to be set
    and the packet acknowledgement function (ackFunc) has to be called.
    It is implementation dependant if all these steps are implemented as part of the
    ackFunc itself or as discrete steps.

  Precondition:
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACSetup() should have been called.

  Parameters:
    hMac        - Ethernet MAC client handle
    ptrPacket   - pointer to a TCPIP_MAC_PACKET that's completely formatted and ready
                  to be transmitted over the network


  Returns:
    TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK if the packet transmitted,
    TCPIP_MAC_RES errocode for not properly formatted packets, etc.

  Example:
<code>
</code>

/* Function:
    TCPIP_MAC_PACKET* DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACPacketRx (TCPIP_MAC_HANDLE hMac, TCPIP_MAC_RES* pRes, const TCPIP_MAC_PACKET_RX_STAT** ppPktStat);

  Summary:
    A packet is returned if  such a pending packet exists.

  Description:
    This is the MAC receive function.
    
    Once a pending packet is available in the MAC driver internal RX queues
    this function will dequeue the packet and hand it over to the
    MAC driver's client - i.e. the stack - for further processing.


    The flags for a RX packet have to be updated by the MAC driver:
        - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_RX has to be set
          If the MAC supports it, it should set: 
            - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_UNICAST has to be set if that packet is a unicast packet
            - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_BCAST has to be set if that packet is a broadcast packet
            - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_MCAST has to be set if that packet is a multicast packet
        - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED has to be set
        - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_SPLIT has to be set if the packet has multiple data segments

    Additional information about the packet is available by providing the pRes and
    ppPktStat fields.

  Precondition:
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACSetup() should have been called.

  Parameters:
    hMac        - Ethernet MAC client handle
    pRes        - optional pointer to an address that will receive an additional
                  result associated with the operation.
                  Can be 0 if not needed.
    ppPktStat   - optional pointer to an address that will receive the received
                  packet status.
                  Note that this pointer cannot be used once the packet
                  acknowledgement function was called.
                  Can be 0 if not needed.


  Returns:
    a valid pointer to an available RX packet
    0 if no packet pending/available

  Example:
<code>
</code>

  Remarks:
    The MAC driver dequeues and return to the caller just one single packet. 

    Once the higher level layers in the stack are done with processing the RX packet,
    they have to call the corresponding packet acknowledgement function
    that tells the MAC driver that it can resume control of that packet.

    Once the stack modules are done processing the RX packets and the acknowledge function is called
    the MAC driver will reuse the RX packets.

    The MAC driver may use the DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACProcess() for obtaining new RX packets if needed.

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    TCPIP_MAC_RES DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACProcess(TCPIP_MAC_HANDLE hMac);

  Summary:
    MAC periodic processing function.

  Description:
    This is a function that allows for internal processing by the MAC driver.
    It is meant for processing that cannot be done from within ISR.

    Some of the processing that this is intended for:
    - the MAC driver can process its pending TX queues
      (although it should do that preferrably from within the TX ISR)
    - RX buffers replenishing. If the number of packets in the RX queue
      falls below a specified limit, the MAC driver can use this function
      to allocate some extra RX packets.
      Similarly, if there are too many allocated RX packets, the MAC driver
      can free some of them.


    Normally this function will be called in response to an TX and/or RX event
    signalled by the driver.
    This is specified by the MAC driver at initialization time using TCPIP_MAC_MODULE_CTRL.

    An alternative approach is that the MAC driver uses a system service
    to create a timer signal that will call the TCPIP_MAC_Process on a periodic basis.

  Precondition:
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACSetup() should have been called.

  Parameters:
    hMac        - Ethernet MAC client handle


  Returns:
    TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK if all processing went on OK
    a TCPIP_MAC_RES error code if processing failed for some reason

  Example:
<code>
</code>

  Remarks:
    The MAC driver may use the DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACProcess() for obtaining new RX packets if needed.

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    bool DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventMaskSet(TCPIP_MAC_HANDLE hMac, TCPIP_MAC_EVENT macEvents, bool enable);

  Summary:
    Enables the MAC events.

  Description:
     This function sets the enabled events.
     Multiple events can be orr-ed together.
     All events that are set will be added to the notification process. The old events will be disabled.
     The stack (or stack user) has to catch the events that are notified and process them:
         - The stack should process the TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_PKTPEND/TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_DONE, TCPIP_MAC_EV_TX_DONE transfer events
         - Process the specific condition and acknowledge them calling DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventAcknowledge() so that they can be re-enabled.


  Precondition:
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACSetup() should have been called.

  Parameters:
    hMac        - Ethernet MAC client handle
    macEvMask - events the user of the stack wants to add/delete for notification
    enable    - if true, the events will  be enabled, else disabled


  Returns:
    always true, operation succeeded.

  Example:
<code>
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventMaskSet( hMac, TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_OVFLOW | TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_BUFNA, true );
</code>

  Remarks:
    The event notification system enables the user of the TCPIP stack to call into the stack
    for processing only when there are relevant events rather than being forced to periodically call
    from within a loop.
    
    If the notification events are nill the interrupt processing will be disabled.
    Otherwise the event notification will be enabled and the interrupts relating to the requested events will be enabled.
    
    Note that once an event has been caught by the stack ISR (and reported if a notification handler is in place)
    it will be disabled until the DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventAcknowledge() is called.

/* Function:

    Acknowledges and re-enables processed events.

  Description:
    This function acknowledges and re-enables processed events.
    Multiple events can be orr-ed together as they are processed together.
    The events acknowledged by this function should be the events that have been retrieved from the stack
    by calling DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventPendingGet() or have been passed to the user by the stack using the notification handler
    (PIC32MACEventSetNotifyHandler()) and have been processed and have to be re-enabled.

  Precondition:
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACSetup() should have been called.

  Parameters:
    hMac        - Ethernet MAC client handle
    tcpAckEv    - the events that the user processed and need to be re-enabled

  Returns:
    true if events acknowledged
    false if no events to be acknowledged

  Example:
<code>
    DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventAcknowledge( hMac, stackNewEvents );
</code>

  Remarks:
    All events should be acknowledged, in order to be re-enabled.

    Some events are fatal errors and should not be acknowledged (TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_BUSERR, TCPIP_MAC_EV_TX_BUSERR).
    Stack re-initialization is needed under such circumstances.

    Some events are just system/application behavior and they are intended only as simple info (TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_OVFLOW,
    TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_BUFNA, TCPIP_MAC_EV_TX_ABORT, TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_ACT).

    The TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_FWMARK and TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_EWMARK events are part of the normal flow control operation (if auto flow control was enabled).
    They should be enabled alternatively, if needed.

    The events are persistent. They shouldn't be re-enabled unless they have been processed and the condition that generated them was removed.
    Re-enabling them immediately without proper processing will have dramatic effects on system performance.

  Function:

  Summary:
    Returns the currently pending events.

  Description:
    This function returns the currently pending events belonging to a group.
    Multiple events can be orr-ed together as they accumulate.
    The stack should be called for processing whenever a stack managed event (TCPIP_MAC_EV_RX_PKTPEND, TCPIP_MAC_EV_TX_DONE) is present.
    The other, non critical events, may not be managed by the stack and passed to an user.
    They will have to be eventually acknowledged if re-enabling is needed.

  Precondition:
   DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACSetup should have been called.

  Parameters:
   hMac      - parameter identifying the intended MAC client  
    
  Returns:
    The currently stack pending events.

  Example:
    <code>
    TCPIP_MAC_EVENT currEvents = DRV_ETHMAC_PIC32MACEventPendingGet( hMac);
    </code>

  Remarks:   
    This is the preferred method to get the current pending MAC events.
    The stack maintains a proper image of the events from their occurrence to their acknowledgement.
    
    Even with a notification handler in place it's better to use this function to get the current pending events
    rather than using the events passed by the notification handler which could be stale.
    
    The events are persistent. They shouldn't be re-enabled unless they have been processed and
    the condition that generated them was removed.
    Re-enabling them immediately without proper processing will have dramatic effects on system performance.

    The returned value is just a momentary value. The pending events can change any time.
