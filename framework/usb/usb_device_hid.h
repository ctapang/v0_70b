/* USB Device HID Function Driver Events

  Summary:
    USB Device HID Function Driver Events

  Description:
    These events are specific to the USB Device HID Function Driver instance.
    Each event description contains details about the  parameters passed with
    event. The contents of pData depends on the generated event.
    
    Events that are associated with the HID Function Driver Specific Control
    Transfers require application response and will be generated along with a
    HID Control Transfer Handle. This allows the application to respond to the
    HID function driver control transfer requests. The application should
    respond to these events by using the USB_DEVICE_HID_ControlReceive(),
    USB_DEVICE_HID_ControlSend() and USB_DEVICE_HID_ControlStatus() functions.
    
    Calling the USB_DEVICE_HID_ControlStatus() function with a
    USB_DEVICE_HID_CONTROL_STATUS_ERROR will stall the control transfer request.
    The application would do this if the control transfer request is not
    supported. Calling the USB_DEVICE_HID_ControlStatus() function with a
    USB_DEVICE_HID_CONTROL_STATUS_OK will complete the status stage of the
    control transfer request. The application would do this if the control
    transfer request is supported 
    
    The following code snippet shows an example of a possible event handling
    scheme.

  Remarks:
    Some of the events allow the application to defer responses. This allows the
    application some time to obtain the response data rather than having to
    respond to the event immediately. Note that a USB host will typically wait
    for event response for a finite time duration before timing out and
    cancelling the event and associated transactions. Even when deferring
    response, the application must respond promptly if such timeouts have to be
    avoided.

    may not function.

    as a result of a set configuration.

  Parameters:

  Summary:
    This function allows the application to respond to the HID function driver
    specific control transfer requests. It allows the application to send data
    to the host in the data stage of the control transfer.

  Description:
    This function allows the application to respond to the HID function driver
    specific control transfer requests. It allows the application to send data
    to the host in the data stage of the control transfer. For example, the
    USB_DEVICE_HID_EVENT_DATA_REPORT_SENT event requires a control transfer
    response. The function can be called in the HID Function Driver event
    handler or can be called outside the event handler. Calling this function
    outside the event handler defers the response to the event. This allows the
    application to prepare the response data out of the event handler context,
    especially if the data is not readily available. Note however, that there
    are timing considerations when responding to the control transfer.
    Exceeding the response time will cause the host to cancel the control
    transfer and may cause USB host to reject the device. The application must
    use the control transfer handle that was generated along with the event as
    the controlTransferHandle. 

  Precondition:
    This function should only be called in response to a HID function driver
    event that requires a control transfer response.

  Parameters:
    instance  - USB Device HID Function Driver instance.

    controlTransferHandle  - Control Transfer handle for the control transfer.

    data -  Data that represents the data stage of the control transfer.

    size - size (in bytes) of the data to sent.

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_ERROR_CONTROL_TRANSFER_FAILED - The request was not
    successful because the USB host cancelled the control transfer.
    
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_OK - The request was successful.

  Example:
    <code>

  Summary:
    This function allows the application to respond to the HID function driver
    specific control transfer requests. It allows the application to receive data
    from the host in the data stage of the control transfer.

  Description:
    This function allows the application to respond to the HID function driver
    specific control transfer requests. It allows the application to receive
    data from the host in the data stage of the control transfer. For example,
    the USB_DEVICE_HID_EVENT_DATA_SET_REPORT event requires a control
    transfer response. The function can be called in the HID Function
    Driver event handler or can be called outside the event handler. Calling
    this function outside the event handler defers the response to the
    event. This allows the application to prepare the data buffer out of
    the event handler context, especially if the data buffer to receive the daya
    is not readily available. Note however, that there are timing
    considerations when responding to the control transfer. Exceeding the
    response time will cause the host to cancel the control transfer and
    may cause USB host to reject the device. The application must use the
    control transfer handle that was generated along with the event as
    the controlTransferHandle. 

  Precondition:
    This function should only be called in response to a HID function driver
    event that requires a control transfer response.

  Parameters:
    instance  - USB Device HID Function Driver instance.

    controlTransferHandle  - Control Transfer handle for the control transfer.

    data -  Data buffer to receive the data stage of the control transfer.

    size - size (in bytes) of the data to sent.

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_ERROR_CONTROL_TRANSFER_FAILED - The request was not
    successful because the USB host cancelled the control transfer.
    
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_OK - The request was successful.

  Summary:
    This function allows the application to complete the status stage of the 
    the HID Function Driver specific control transfer request.

  Description:
    This function allows the application to complete the status stage of the the
    HID Function Driver specific control transfer request. The application can
    either accept the data stage or stall it. Calling this function with status
    set to USB_DEVICE_HID_CONTROL_STATUS_OK will acknowledge the status stage of
    the control transfer. The control transfer can be stalled by setting the
    status parameter to USB_DEVICE_HID_CONTROL_STATUS_ERROR. The function can be
    called in the HID Function Driver event handler or can be called outside the
    event handler. Calling this function outside the event handler defers the
    response to the event. This allows the application to analyze the event
    response outside the event handler. Note however, that there are timing
    considerations when responding to the control transfer. Exceeding the
    response time will cause the host to cancel the control transfer and may
    cause USB host to reject the device. The application must use the control
    transfer handle that was generated along with the event as the
    controlTransferHandle. The application must be aware of events and
    associated control transfers that do or do not require data stages.
    Incorrect usage of the USB_DEVICE_HID_ControlStatus() function could cause
    the device function to be non-compliant.

  Precondition:
    This function should only be called in response to a HID function driver
    event that requires a control transfer response. 

  Parameters:
    instance  - USB Device HID Function Driver instance.

    controlTransferHandle  - Control Transfer handle for the control transfer.

    status - Set to USB_DEVICE_HID_CONTROL_STATUS_OK to acknowledge the
    control transfer. Set to USB_DEVICE_HID_CONTROL_STATUS_ERROR to stall the
    transfer.

  Returns:
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_ERROR_CONTROL_TRANSFER_FAILED - The request was not
    successful because the USB host cancelled the control transfer.
    
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_OK - The request was successful.
