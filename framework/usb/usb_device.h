  Summary:
    Creates and initializes an instance of the USB device layer.

  Description:
    This function initializes an instance of USB device layer, making it ready
    for clients to open and use it. The number of instances is limited by the 
    value of macro USB_DEVICE_MAX_INSTANCES.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    instanceIndex     - In case of microcontrollers with multiple USB peripherals,
                        user can create multiple instances of USB device layer.
                        Parameter instanceIndex identifies this instance.
    
    init              - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary
                        to initialize the USB device layer

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a device layer object. 
    Otherwise, it returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID. 

  Example:
    <code>

    size.  The function will  enable  the  endpoint  for  communication  in  one
    direction at a time.  It must be called twice if the  endpoint  is  required
    to communicate in both the directions, except for control endpoints.  If the
    endpoint  type   is   a   control   endpoint,   the   endpoint   is   always
    bi-directional  and  the  function   needs   to   be   called   only   once.
    The size of the endpoint must  match  the  wMaxPacketSize  reported  in  the
    endpoint  descriptor for this endpoint.  The function does not check if the
    endpoint  is  already in use.  It is the client's responsibility to make sure
    that a  endpoint  is  not accidently re-used.

  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle  -        USB device handle returned by USB_DEVICE_Open().

    endpointAndDirection    - Specifies the endpoint and direction.
    transferType            - Should be USB_TRANSFER_TYPE_CONTROL for control
                              endpoint, USB_TRANSFER_TYPE_BULK for bulk endpoint,
                              USB_TRANSFER_TYPE_INTERRUPT for interrupt endpoint
                              and USB_TRANSFER_TYPE_ISOCHRONOUS for isochronous
                              endpoint.
    endpointSize            - Maximum size (in bytes) of the endpoint as
                              reported in the endpoint descriptor.

  Returns:
    USB_ERROR_NONE - The endpoint was successfully enabled.
    USB_ERROR_DEVICE_ENDPOINT_INVALID - If the endpoint that is being accessed is
                                        is out of the valid endpoint defined for

  Summary:
    This function submits a I/O Request Packet (IRP) for  processing to the
    USB Driver.

  Description:
    This function submits a I/O Request  Packet  (IRP)  for  processing  to  the
    USB Driver.  The IRP allows a client to send and receive data from  the  USB
    Host.  The data will sent or received through the specified  endpoint.   The
    direction of the data transfer is indicated by the  direction  flag  in  the
    endpointAndDirection structure.  Submitting an  IRP  arms  the  endpoint  to
    either send data to or receive data from the  host.   If  an  IRP  is  under
    progress on the endpoint, then the  subsequent  IRP  submit  operation  will
    result in the IRPs getting queued.  The contents of the IRP  should  not  be
    changed till the IRP has been processed.

    Particular attention should be paid to  the  size  parameter  of  IRP.   The
    following should be noted:

    * The size parameter while sending data  to  the  host  can  be  less  than,
      greater than, equal to or be an exact multiple of maximum packet size  for
      the endpoint.  The maximum packet size for  the  endpoint  determines  the
      number of transactions required to process the IRP.
    * If the size parameter while sending data to the host is less than  maximum
      packet  size,   the   transfer   will   complete   in   one   transaction.
    * If the size parameter while sending data  to  the  host  is  greater  than
      maximum packet size, the IRP will be processed in  mulitple  transactions.
    * If the size parameter while sending data to the host is  equal  to  or  an
      exact multiple of the maximum  packet  size,  the  client  can  optionally
      ask  the  driver  to  send  a  Zero  Length  packet  by   specifying   the
      USB_DEVICE_IRP_FLAG_SEND_ZLP flag as the flag parameter.
    * The size parameter while receiving data from the host  must  be  an  exact
      multiple of the maximum packet size of the endpoint.  If this is  not  the
      case, the driver will return  a  USB_DEVICE_IRP_SUBMIT_RESULT_INVALID_SIZE
      result. If while processing the IRP, the driver receives less than maximum
      packet size or a ZLP from the  host,  the  driver  considers  the  IRP  as
      processed. The size paramter at this point contains the actual amount of
      data received from the host.

  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid.

  Parameters:
     usbDeviceHandle  -        USB device handle returned by USB_DEVICE_Open().
 
    endpointAndDirection    - Specifies the endpoint and direction.
    irp                     - Pointer to the USB_DEVICE_IRP structure.

  Returns:
    USB_ERROR_NONE - if the IRP was submitted successful.
    USB_ERROR_IRP_SIZE_INVALID - if the size parameter of the IRP is not correct.
    USB_ERROR_IRP_QUEUE_FULL - if the driver IRP queue is full.

  Example:
    <code>
    // The following code snippet shows an example of how to schedule a

  Description:
    This function cancels all IRPs that  are  queued  and  in  progress  at  the

    instances; when it has called the IRP callback and is ready to proccess  the
    next IRP in the queue and when it is ready to process the  next  transaction
    in the the current IRP.  It is recommended that this function be  called  in
    the IRP callback of the IRP that just completed as this ensures that an  IRP
    in progress is not cancelled.  Cancelling an IRP that is progress may  cause
    disturbance to the USB host firmware.  Cancelling the  IRP  from  any  other
    location, other  than  a  IRP  callback  could  cause  an  IRP  that  is  in

/* Function:
    void USB_DEVICE_Attach( USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle )

  Summary:
    This function will attach the device to the USB.

  Description:
    This function will attach the device to the USB.  It does this  by  enabling
    the pull up resistors on the D+ or D- lines. This function should be called
    when the USB device layer is ready  to  receive  communication  from  the  host
    (typically after all initialization is complete).

  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle   - Client's USB device layer handle (returned from
                        USB_DEVICE_Open)

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>

    USB_DEVICE_INIT deviceLayerInit;
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ usbDeviceObj;
    USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle;

     // System module initialization
    deviceLayerInit.moduleInit.value = SYS_MODULE_POWER_RUN_FULL;
     // Identifies peripheral (PLIB-level) ID
    deviceLayerInit.usbID = USB_ID_1;
    // Boolean flag: true -> Stop USB module in Idle Mode
    deviceLayerInit.stopInIdle = false;
    // Boolean flag: true -> Suspend USB in Sleep Mode
    deviceLayerInit.suspendInSleep = false;
     // Interrupt Source for USB module
    deviceLayerInit.interruptSource = INT_SOURCE_USB_1;
    // Number of function drivers registered to this instance of the
    USB device layer
    deviceLayerInit.registeredFuncCount = 1;
    // Function driver table registered to this instance of the USB device layer
    deviceLayerInit.registeredFunctions = funcRegistrationTable;
    // Pointer to USB Descriptor structure
    deviceLayerInit.usbMasterDescriptor   = &usbMasterDescriptor;

/* Function:
    void USB_DEVICE_Detach( USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle );

  Summary:
    This function will detach the device from the USB. 

  Description:
    This function will detach  the  device  from  the  USB.   It  does  this  by
    disabling the pull up resistors on the D+ or D- lines. This function should
    be called when the application wants to disconnect the device  from  the  bus
    (typically to implement a soft detach or switch  to  host  mode  operation).

  Precondition:
    Client handle should be valid.

  Parameters:
    usbDeviceHandle    - Client's driver handle (returned from USB_DEVICE_Open)

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    USB_DEVICE_HANDLE usbDeviceHandle;
