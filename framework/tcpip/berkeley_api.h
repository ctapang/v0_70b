 Function:
   SOCKET socket( int af, int type, int protocol )

 Summary:
   This function creates a new Berkeley socket.

 Description:
   This function creates a new BSD socket for the microchip
   TCPIP stack. The return socket descriptor is used for the subsequent
   BSD operations.

 Precondition:
   BerkeleySocketInit function should be called.

 Parameters:
   af - address family - AF_INET.
   type - socket type SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_STREAM.
   protocol - IP protocol IPPROTO_UDP or IPPROTO_TCP.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    int bind( SOCKET s, const struct sockaddr* name, int namelen )

  Summary:
    This function assigns a name to the socket descriptor.

  Description:
    The bind function assigns a name to an unnamed socket. The
    name represents the local address of the communication
    endpoint. For sockets of type SOCK_STREAM, the name of the
    remote endpoint is assigned when a connect or accept function
    is executed.

  Precondition:
    socket function should be called.

  Parameters:
    s - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket.
    name - pointer to the sockaddr structure containing the
    local address of the socket.
    namelen - length of the sockaddr structure.

  Returns:
    If bind is successful, a value of 0 is returned. A return
    value of SOCKET_ERROR indicates an error.
    (and errno set accordingly).

  Remarks:
    None.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    int listen( SOCKET s, int backlog )

  Summary:
    The listen function sets the specified socket in a listen mode

  Description:
    This function sets the specified socket in a listen
    mode. Calling the listen function indicates that the
    application is ready to accept connection requests arriving
    at a socket of type SOCK_STREAM. The connection request is
    queued (if possible) until accepted with an accept function.
    The backlog parameter defines the maximum number of pending
    connections that may be queued.

  Precondition:
    bind() must have been called on the s socket first.

  Parameters:
    s - Socket identifier returned from a prior socket() call.
    backlog - Maximum number of connection requests that can be queued.  Note
        that each backlog requires a TCP socket to be allocated.

  Returns:
    Returns 0 on success, else return SOCKET_ERROR.
    (and errno set accordingly).

  Remarks:
    None

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    SOCKET accept(SOCKET s, struct sockaddr* addr, int* addrlen)

  Summary:
    This function accepts connection requests queued for a listening socket.

  Description:
    The accept function is used to accept connection requests
    queued for a listening socket. If a connection request is
    pending, accept removes the request from the queue, and a new
    socket is created for the connection. The original listening
    socket remains open and continues to queue new connection
    requests. The socket must be a SOCK_STREAM type socket.

  Precondition:
    listen function should be called.

  Parameters:
    s - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to
    socket. must be bound to a local name and in listening mode.
    addr - Optional pointer to a buffer that receives the address
    of the connecting entity.
    addrlen - Optional pointer to an integer that contains the
    length of the address addr

  Returns:
    If the accept function succeeds, it returns a non-negative
    integer that is a descriptor for the accepted socket.
    Otherwise, the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned.
    (and errno set accordingly).

  Remarks:
    None.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    int connect( SOCKET s, struct sockaddr* name, int namelen )

  Summary:
    This function connects to the peer communications end point.

  Description:
    The connect function assigns the address of the peer
    communications endpoint. For stream sockets, connection is
    established between the endpoints. For datagram sockets, an
    address filter is established between the endpoints until
    changed with another connect() function.

  Precondition:
    socket function should be called.

  Parameters:
    s - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket.
    name - pointer to the sockaddr structure containing the
    peer address and port number.
    namelen - length of the sockaddr structure.

  Returns:
    If the connect() function succeeds, it returns 0. Otherwise,
    the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned to indicate an error
    condition (and errno set accordingly).
    For stream based socket, if the connection is not
    established yet, connect returns SOCKET_ERROR and
    errno = EINPROGRESS.

  Remarks:
    None.

  Function:
    int send( SOCKET s, const char* buf, int len, int flags )

  Summary:
    The send function is used to send outgoing data on an already
    connected socket.

  Description:
    The send function is used to send outgoing data on an already
    connected socket. This function is used to send a reliable,
    ordered stream of data bytes on a socket of type SOCK_STREAM
    but can also be used to send datagrams on a socket of type SOCK_DGRAM.

  Precondition:
    connect function should be called for TCP and UDP sockets.
    Server side, accept function should be called.

  Parameters:
    s - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket.
    buf - application data buffer containing data to transmit.
    len - length of data in bytes.
    flags - message flags. Currently this field is not supported.

  Returns:
    On success, send returns number of bytes sent.
    Zero indicates no data send.
    In case of error it returns SOCKET_ERROR
    (and errno set accordingly).

  Remarks:
    None.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    int recv( SOCKET s, char* buf, int len, int flags )

  Summary:
    The recv() function is used to receive incoming data that has
    been queued for a socket.

  Description:
    The recv() function is used to receive incoming data that has
    been queued for a socket. This function can be used with both
    datagram and stream socket. If the available data
    is too large to fit in the supplied application buffer buf,
    excess bytes are discarded in case of SOCK_DGRAM type
    sockets.  For SOCK_STREAM types, the data is buffered
    internally so the application can retreive all data by
    multiple calls of recvfrom.

  Precondition:
    connect function should be called for TCP and UDP sockets.
    Server side, accept function should be called.

  Parameters:
    s - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket.
    buf - application data receive buffer.
    len - buffer length in bytes.
    flags - no significance in this implementation

  Returns:
    If recv is successful, the number of bytes copied to
    application buffer buf is returned.
    A return value of SOCKET_ERROR (-1)
    indicates an error condition (and errno set accordingly).
    A value of zero indicates socket has been shutdown by the peer.

  Remarks:
    None.
