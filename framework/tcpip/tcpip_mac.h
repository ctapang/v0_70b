/*  TCPIP MAC Data Segment

  Summary:
    A data segment that's part of a TX/RX packet.

  Description:
    Structure of a segment buffer transferred with the MAC.
    A MAC TX or RX packet can consist of multiple data segments.
    On TX the MAC has to be able to transmit packets that span
    multiple data segments.
    On RX of a network frame the MAC may have to use multiple segments to 
    construct a packet.
    (For performance reasons, a contiguous MAC packet, with just one segment, if possible, is preferred).
   
  
  Remarks:
    See notes for the segLoadOffset member.

    On 32 bit machines the segment payload is allocated so that it is always
    32 bit aligned and its size is 32 bits multiple.
    The segLoadOffset adds to the payload address and insures that the network layer data
    is 32 bit aligned.

/*******************************************************************************
  event notification Function:
    typedef void    (*TCPIP_MAC_EventF)(TCPIP_MAC_EVENT event, const void* eventParam);

  Summary:
    MAC event notification handler.

  Description:
    This function describes the MAC event notification handler.
    This is a handler specified by the user of the MAC (the TCP/IP stack).
    The stack can use the handler to be notified of MAC events.
    Whenever a notification occurs the passed events have to be eventually processed:
    - Stack should process the TCPIP_EV_RX_PKTPEND/TCPIP_EV_RX_DONE, TCPIP_EV_TX_DONE  events
    - Process the specific (error) condition
    - Acknowledge the events by calling TCPIP_MAC_EventAcknowledge() so that they can be re-enabled.

  Precondition:
   None

  Parameters:
    event        - event that's reported (multiple events can be OR-ed)  
    eventParam   - user parameter that's used in the notification handler
    
  Returns:
   None


  Remarks:   
    The notification handler will be called from the ISR which detects the corresponding event.
    The event notification handler has to be kept as short as possible and non-blocking.
    Mainly useful for RTOS integration where this handler will wake-up a thread that waits for a MAC event to occur.

    The event notification system also enables the user of the TCPIP stack to call into the stack
    for processing only when there are relevant events rather than being forced to periodically call
    from within a loop at unknown moments.

    Without a notification handler the stack user can still call TCPIP_MAC_EventPendingGet() to see if processing by the stack needed.

    This is a default way of adding MAC interrupt processing to the TCP/IP stack.

/*  TCPIP_MAC_PacketTx

  Summary:
    A packet is submitted to the MAC driver for transmission.

  Description:
    This is the MAC transmit function.
    The MAC driver has to suport internal queueing!
    A packet is to be rejected only if it's not properly formatted.
    Otherwise it has to be scheduled for transmission in an internal queue!

    Once the packet is scheduled for transmission
    the MAC driver has to set the TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED flag so that the stack
    is aware that this packet is under processing cnd cannot be modified!

    Once the packet is transmitted, the TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED has to be cleared,
    the proper packet acknowledgement result (ackRes) has to be set
    and the packet acknowledgement function (ackFunc) has to be called.
    It is implementation dependant if all these steps are implemented as part of the
    ackFunc itself or as discrete steps.


  Parameters:
    hMac        - handle identifying the MAC driver client
    ptrPacket   - pointer to a TCPIP_MAC_PACKET that's completely formatted and ready
                  to be transmitted over the network



  Remarks:
    See notes for the segLoadOffset member.

    On 32 bit machines the 1st segment payload of a packet 
    is allocated so that it is always
    32 bit aligned and its size is 32 bits multiple.
    The segLoadOffset adds to the payload address and insures that the network layer data
    is 32 bit aligned.
        - PIC32 MAC driver specific : the driver checks that the segLoadOffset >= 2. 

    The packet is not required to contain the Frame Check Sequence (FCS/CRC32) field.
    The MAC driver/controller will insert that field itself, if it's required.

    The MAC driver is required to support the transmission of multiple chained packets.

// *****************************************************************************
/*  TCPIP_MAC_PacketRx

  Summary:
    A packet is returned if  such a pending packet exists.

  Description:
    This is the MAC receive function.
    
    Once a pending packet is available in the MAC driver internal RX queues
    this function will dequeue the packet and hand it over to the
    MAC driver's client - i.e. the stack - for further processing.


    The flags for a RX packet have to be updated by the MAC driver:
        - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_RX has to be set
          If the MAC supports it, it should set: 
            - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_UNICAST has to be set if that packet is a unicast packet
            - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_BCAST has to be set if that packet is a broadcast packet
            - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_MCAST has to be set if that packet is a multicast packet
        - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_QUEUED has to be set
        - TCPIP_MAC_PKT_FLAG_SPLIT has to be set if the packet has multiple data segments

    Additional information about the packet is available by providing the pRes and
    ppPktStat fields.



  Parameters:
    hMac        - handle identifying the MAC driver client
    pRes        - optional pointer to an address that will receive an additional
                  result associated with the operation.
                  Can be 0 if not needed.
    ppPktStat   - optional pointer to an address that will receive the received
                  packet status.
                  Note that this pointer cannot be used once the packet
                  acknowledgement function was called.
                  Can be 0 if not needed.

  Returns:
    a valid pointer to an available RX packet
    0 if no packet pending/available



  Remarks:
    The MAC driver should dequeue and return to the caller just one single packet, 
    and not multiple chained packets!

    Once the higher level layers in the stack are done with processing the RX packet,
    they have to call the corresponding packet acknowledgement function
    that tells the owner of that packet that it can resume control of that packet.

    Once the stack modules are done processing the RX packets and the acknowledge function is called
    it is up to the driver design to reuse the RX packets, or simply return them to the pool
    they were allocated from (assuming that some sort of allocation is implemented).
    This document makes no requirement about how the MAC RX packets are obtained,
    using dynamic or static allocation techniques.
    This is up to the design of the MAC.

    The MAC driver can use the TCPIP_MAC_Process() for obtaining new RX packets if needed.

    Not all the MACs have hardware support for the received packet status.
    If the MAC driver cannot supply the TCPIP_MAC_PACKET_RX_STAT info,
    it should set the ppPktStat to 0.

// *****************************************************************************
/*  TCPIP_MAC_Process

  Summary:
    MAC periodic processing function.

  Description:
    This is a function that allows for internal processing by the MAC driver.
    It is meant for processing that cannot be done from within ISR.

    Some of the processing that this is intended for:
    - the MAC driver can process its pending TX queues
      (although it should do that preferrably from within the TX ISR)
    - RX buffers replenishing. If the number of packets in the RX queue
      falls below a specified limit, the MAC driver can use this function
      to allocate some extra RX packets.
      Similarly, if there are too many allocated RX packets, the MAC driver
      can free some of them.


    Normally this function will be called in response to an TX and/or RX event
    signalled by the driver.
    This is specified by the MAC driver at initialization time using TCPIP_MAC_MODULE_CTRL.

    An alternative approach is that the MAC driver uses a system service
    to create a timer signal that will call the TCPIP_MAC_Process on a periodic basis.



  Parameters:
    hMac        - handle identifying the MAC driver client

  Returns:
    TCPIP_MAC_RES_OK if all processing went on OK
    a TCPIP_MAC_RES error code if processing failed for some reason



  Remarks:
    None.
