 * Description:
 *      The FindNext function performs the same function as the FindFirst funciton,
 *      except it does not copy any search parameters into the SearchRec structure

 *      entry offset at which a file was found, rather than at the beginning of the
 *      current working directory.

 * Params:
 *        rcd : pointer to a structure to put the file information in
 *
 * Return: 0 - RETURN_SUCCESS, other value - failed
