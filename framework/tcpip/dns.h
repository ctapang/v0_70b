  Function:
    DNS_RESULT TCPIP_DNS_UsageBegin(TCPIP_NET_HANDLE netH)

  Summary:
    Claims access to the DNS module.

  Description:
    This function acts as a semaphore to obtain usage of the DNS module.
    Call this function and ensure that it returns DNS_RES_OK before calling any
    other DNS APIs.  Call TCPIP_DNS_UsageEnd when this application no longer
    needs the DNS module so that other applications may make use of it.

  Precondition:
    Stack is initialized.

  Parameters:
    netH   - interface to use
                If 0, a default interface will be selected

  Return Values:
    DNS_RES_OK      - the calling application has sucessfully taken ownership of the DNS module
    DNS_RES_BUSY    - The DNS module is currently in use.
                      Yield to the stack and attempt this call again later.

  Remarks:
    Ensure that TCPIP_DNS_UsageEnd is always called once your application has
    obtained control of the DNS module.  If this is not done, the stack
    will hang for all future applications requiring DNS access.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    void TCPIP_DNS_Resolve(uint8_t* Hostname, DNS_RESOLVE_TYPE Type)

  Summary:
    Begins resolution of an address.

  Description:
    This function attempts to resolve a host name to an IP address.  When
    called, it starts the DNS state machine.  Call TCPIP_DNS_IsResolved repeatedly
    to determine if the resolution is complete.

    Only one DNS resoultion may be executed at a time.  The Hostname must
    not be modified in memory until the resolution is complete.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_DNS_UsageBegin returned DNS_RES_OK on a previous call.

  Parameters:
    Hostname - A pointer to the null terminated string specifiying the
        host for which to resolve an IP.
    RecordType - DNS_TYPE_A or DNS_TYPE_MX depending on what type of
        record resolution is desired.

  Returns:
    DNS_RES_OK

  Remarks:
    This function requires access to one UDP socket.  If none are available,
    UDP_MAX_SOCKETS may need to be increased.

  Function:
    DNS_RESULT TCPIP_DNS_IsResolved(const char* HostName, IPV4_ADDR* HostIP)

  Summary:
    Determines if the DNS resolution is complete and provides the IP.

  Description:
    Call this function to determine if the DNS resolution of an address has
    been completed.  If so, the resolved address will be provided in HostIP.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_DNS_Resolve has been called.

  Parameters:
    Hostname - A pointer to the null terminated string specifiying the
        host for which to resolve an IP.
    HostIP - A pointer to an IPV4_ADDR structure in which to store the
        resolved IP address once resolution is complete.

  Return Values:
    DNS_RES_OK       - The DNS client has obtained an IP
                       HostIP will contain the resolved address.
    DNS_RES_PENDING  - The resolution process is still in progress.
    DNS_RES_SERVER_TMO  - DNS server timed out
    DNS_RES_NO_ENTRY - no such entry to be resolved exists

    None.

  Function:

  Summary:
    Releases control of the DNS module.

  Description:
    This function acts as a semaphore to release control of the DNS module.
    Call this function when this application no longer needs the DNS
    module so that other applications may make use of it.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_DNS_UsageBegin returned DNS_RES_OK on a previous call.

  Parameters:
    netH   - interface to release
                Not used.

  Return Values:
    DNS_RES_OK - The DNS module successfully released.

  Remarks:
    Ensure that TCPIP_DNS_UsageEnd is always called once your application has
    obtained control of the DNS module.  If this is not done, the stack
