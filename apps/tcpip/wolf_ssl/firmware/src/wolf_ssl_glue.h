/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    int TCPIP_WSSL_CreateConnection(WOLF_SSL_CONNECTION_INFO * info, const char * hostname, TCP_PORT port)

  Summary:
 Helper function to create an SSL connection to the hostname and port provided

  Description:
 This function initializes info structure and starts up the dns query.  The
 TCPIP_WSSL_PumpConnection function should then be called until WOLF_SSL_CS_SSL_CONNECTED
 is returned.  At that point the SSL connection is opened.

  Precondition:
   TCPIP must be initialized, CyaSSL_Init() must be called to initialize the
 Wolf SSL stack

  Parameters:
    info   - pointer to the ssl connection structure
    hostname   - the name of the host to initiate the connection to.
    port    - the port to connect to

  Return Values:
    WOLF_SSL_CS_ERROR - Something has gone wrong
    WOLF_SSL_CS_DNS_QUERY_STARTED - If everything started properly.
    All other values should not be returned.

  Remarks:
 Use this function to start a connection.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    int8_t TCPIP_WSSL_PumpConnection(WOLF_SSL_CONNECTION_INFO * info);

  Summary:
 Helper function to walk the connection state machine

  Description:
 This function will handle the DNS query, and open up a TCP/IP connection.
 It will also handle closing and cleaning up the connection

  Precondition:
   TCPIP must be initialized, and a info structure initialized with
 TCPIP_WSSL_CreateConnection()

  Parameters:
    info   - pointer to the ssl connection structure

  Return Values:
    WOLF_SSL_CS_ERROR - Something has gone wrong
    WOLF_SSL_CS_DNS_QUERY_STARTED - The DNS query is still running
    WOLF_SSL_CS_SYN_SENT - The TCP/IP connection is opening
    WOLF_SSL_CS_TCP_OPEN - The TCP/IP connection has started and
                           the SSL connection opened, but negotiation
                           is still executing
    WOLF_SSL_CS_SSL_CONNECTED - The SSL connection is fully open
    WOLF_SSL_CS_SSL_CLOSING - The connection is being torn down
    WOLF_SSL_CS_CLOSED - The connection is closed
    All other values should not be returned

  Remarks:
 Use this function while waiting for the connection to open and close.
 You don't need to use it while in the WOLF_SSL_CS_SSL_CONNECTED state.

  Summary:
 Helper function to close the connection

  Description:
 This function will handle the DNS query, and open up a TCP/IP connection.

  Precondition:
   TCPIP must be initialized, and a info structure initialized with
 TCPIP_WSSL_CreateConnection()

  Parameters:
